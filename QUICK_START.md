# Quick Start

## 1. Start the GUI

```bash
cd ahab-gui
./start.sh
```

## 2. Open Browser

Go to: http://localhost:5000

## 3. Follow the GUI

The interface explains everything:
- What each button does
- How long it takes
- Which command runs

## That's It!

The GUI is designed to be self-explanatory. Just read the descriptions and click buttons.

## Need to Change Something?

Edit `.env` file:
- `AHAB_PATH` - Where Ahab is located
- `WUI_PORT` - Which port to use

Then restart with `./start.sh`
